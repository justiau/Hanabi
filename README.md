# Hanabi
An implementation of the card game "Hanabi" built using Java. It uses a text based UI to handle commands and a simple AI can be found and edited in the `generateCommand()` function located in `src/AI.java`.
Running the command `ai` within the program will result in playing the move generated by the AI.
